# Simple C programming examples

Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written.  I do not consider myself a programmer, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.  If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at codersheadquarter@gmail.com.
In the scripts the comments etc are lined up correctly when they are viewed in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). This is what I use to code Every scripts.

- `Hello.c` - This will print Hello World.
- `DisplayAddress.c` - This will read and display int stored in an arrey with the address of the position.
- `ReadDisplay.c` - This will read and display n int no using an arrey.
- `add_int.c` - This will add int stored in an arrey by user.
- `menu.c` - This is a MENU driven function for creating an arrey, insertion elements, deleting elements and display the arrey.
- `ptrn.c` - This will find and replace a sting given by user, using a pattern matching algorithm.
- `stack.c` - This is a MENU driven function for creating a Stack, insertion elements(PUSH), deleting elements(POP) , display the stack, check if the stack is palindrome or not. Supported by all Over_flow and Under_flow cases.
- `eval_postfix.c` -T his script is to evaluate a given postfix expression.
- `toh.c` - Tower Of Hanoi Script.
- `infix_suffix.c` - This script will convert the given Infix expression to postfix expression.
